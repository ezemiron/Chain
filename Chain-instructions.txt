Versions of ChaiN are currently in wolf4192/Chain/

Test dataset:
~/Chain-backup/test2125/data/C127/G1/CTCF
or
~/sandbox/C127

Test output
~/Chain-backup/results ...

Can't use sshfs because 2125 does not have it installed
Can't used mount (below) because I need to be root.
Currently just have to copy the date into the actual chain data folder

(this mounting does not currently work:
Mount data as read-only from micron 5 to bioch7134
mount -Br ~/Chain-backup/test2125/data ~/Chain/eze/Documents/papers/chrom_marks/data

Mount results
mount -B ~/Chain-backup/test2125/results ~/Chain/eze/Documents/papers/chrom_marks/results/
)

Currently need to copy all of G1 data from all the trip directories in bioc1090/data which also end in the "*SIR_THR_ALN.tif" and "*MCNR-mask.tif":

find LS2018-07-03_1_C127_Trip/ -type f \( -name "*G1*" -and \( -name "*SIR_THR_ALN.tif" -or -name "*MCNR-mask.tif" \) \) -exec cp {} ~/papers/data/C127/Trip \;

Then need to scp to my own machine to open all and save them as tifs again in imageJ with a OS.ijm macro.

Then scp to copy them back to data in chain.


Do make distribution (make -j8 distribution)
make d2b
make d2bfit
make d2bnorm

Then to aggregate the distribution and network data:
Summary.R
	spot-class-count.R
		dist_compile.R
		SA2vol.R

To aggregate d2b data:
summaryd2b.R
	d2b_compile.R
